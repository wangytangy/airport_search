Create a web app that calculates the distance (in nautical miles) between two airports. The app should autocomplete the airports and should feature all airports in the U.S. only. Bonus: plot the trip on Google maps. If you are using npm, please do not include your node_modules folder and make sure that all your requirements are in package.json.

2) Read airports from csv file on document load?

Search airports
1) Fire AJAX call to api to fetch airport by name after input change delay
2) Search with JSON array from csv file

OR

1) Fire request when searching (onkeyup event)
2) Use clear interval/setinterval to delay request
3) During long pauses (500ms), display responses in <ul> list
