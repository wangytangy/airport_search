Create a web app that calculates the distance (in nautical miles) between two airports. The app should autocomplete the airports and should feature all airports in the U.S. only. Bonus: plot the trip on Google maps. If you are using npm, please do not include your node_modules folder and make sure that all your requirements are in package.json.
